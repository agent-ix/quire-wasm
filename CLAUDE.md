## Hash / digest / pin antipattern: present, slated for removal

This repository still contains hashes, digests, SHAs, pins, checksum catalogs and
records that track files, versions or tools. That is an antipattern and it is slated
for removal. Do not introduce any new use of it. When you touch code or specs that
contain one, remove it as part of the change. The only hash that stays is a canonical
identity digest that binds a proof to the exact content it proved. Package versions
live in Cargo.toml / package.json and their lockfiles only; reports name the app
version they ran.
